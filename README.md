TOT APP is a Flutter application that integrates with the FreeTestAPI for Dogs to display and manage information about different dog breeds. The app allows users to browse dog details, search for dogs by breed or name, and save their favorite dogs into a local database.

Features
Dog List Screen: Fetches and displays a list of all dogs with their breed, name, and images.
Dog Detail Screen: Displays detailed information about each dog, including breed group and description.
Search Functionality: Allows users to search for dogs by name or breed.
Save Feature: Lets users save their favorite dogs into a local database and view the saved list.
Local Database: Stores saved dog information in SQLite or Hive for easy access.
UI/UX: A clean, intuitive user interface with smooth navigation and loading indicators.
In the Saved Dogs Screen, the app uses a Dismissible widget to enable swipe-to-delete functionality. When a user swipes a dog entry, a "Delete" button appears, and upon clicking it, the dog is removed from the local database.
